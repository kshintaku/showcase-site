# Showcase Site

Working on really basic HTML, CSS, and JS to create a multi purpose template site.

## Inspiration

Many of my friends could benefit from a very simple page with no sever and creating a template of multi use elements can make changes and modification easy to allow each site to be unique.

## Usage

Most of the components are broken up and individually named with some common styling that is concentrated in `style.css`. All other files should match their component or page.
