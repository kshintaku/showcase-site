## Inspiration

Many of my friends could benefit from a very simple page with no sever and creating a template of multi use elements can make changes and modification easy to allow each site to be unique.

## Usage

Most of the components are broken up and individually named with some common styling that is concentrated in `style.css`. All other files should match their component or page.

I'm trying to compartamentalize things better and use more classless CSS designs but just trying to get things working nicely for now.

## Next Steps

Need to work on creating some actual content and working on loading order.

Site needs to be perceived as loading faster.
